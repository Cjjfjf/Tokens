# What did you do to my token?
I have collected information about it and added it to my database and then invalidated it. Nothing more, nothing less

# How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that private as to not guide malicious people into doing the same

# How much for the tool?
I'm not going to sell any ""tool"". The whole purpose of this project is to bother the ones stealing tokens, not selling a tool so someone can get free tokens.

# U mad? 
Cry harder
