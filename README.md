# Tokens

Why is my token is here?
You either got grabbed or I found your token in some weird page. Protect your Discord access token and don't open link or executables from people you don't trust.

## Why i'm doing this?
I hate malware and fake verification bots so yeah...

You can see all the information of the fake verification bots [here](Fake%20verification%20bot%20information)

All bots and owners are added to a global blacklist.

Do you have any issue with me nuking your fake verification bot/stolen accounts token(s) and publishing your discord username, discriminator and id? Cry harder, you can complain all you want i won't stop.

## The "Protect your bot token please" file
If i find some valid bot token exposed i'll invalidate it to PROTECT your bot and your account. 
You should save your bot token in a ENV variable or similar so if some bad actor finds your token you dont get into trouble.
